# Music Mapper
Music Mapper is a ReactJS / Express web application that enables users to perform search queries and visualise the results on a Google Map embed.
Users can seach for and select three different genres, and view on the map popular artists from those genres, or they can search for an artist and view popular artists similar to that chosen artist.
